            <p class = "indentText"> I have been slowly putting together some R markdown which introduces Bayesian modeling in R using the rJAGS package. This has mostly spun out of my attempting to learn the topic myself, and it is still very much a work in progress, but I will update it as things become more fleshed out. You can access the markdown file <a href = "https://joe-young-research.github.io/about/rJagsNotes.html">here</a>. </p>
            <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 5">Project Euler in R</h4>
      <p class = "indentText"><a href = "https://projecteuler.net/about"> Project Euler</a> is consistently updated set of math and computer programing based problems meant to help improve working knowledge of code and build problem solving skills. I have been going through these problems in my spare time both to improve my own programing, as well as to document the solutions to the problem set in the R programming language. <br><br> My solutions are often clunky and imperfect but they do produce the right answers! hopefully they can help to provide some amount of assistance to others. You can look at my current solutions on <a href = "https://github.com/joe-young-research/about/tree/main/ProjectEuler">GitHub</a>.
